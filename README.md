Differential Engine
===================

A command line based tool which can be used for basic differentiation written on Borland's Turbo C++ compiler.  built this with a friend (Skanda Shekhar) back in 11th grade (so, don't judge!).

What all does the tool do?
--------------------------
1. Basic algebraic differentiation upto the nth power
2. Basic trigonometric differentiation
3. Exponential and logarithmic differentiation
4. Combination of all of the above using Leibnitz' Chain rule
